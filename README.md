# 🌍 World Life Expectancy - Data Cleaning with MySQL

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my Data Analyst learning journey and focuses on **Data Cleaning** using **MySQL**. The dataset used contains information on **life expectancy, country status (developing/developed), GDP, and other health-related factors** for different countries and years.

The project follows a structured approach to **identify and fix common data quality issues**, such as:
- **Handling duplicate records**
- **Filling missing values**
- **Ensuring data consistency**

This project is inspired by the **Analyst Builder** course by [Alex Freberg](https://www.analystbuilder.com).
